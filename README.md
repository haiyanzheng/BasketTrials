# BasketTrialsSSD
This repository contains R functions to implement Bayesian sample size determination in basket trials that consider borrowing of information between commensurate subtrials, specifically for reproducing the numerical results and/or graphical representation of the paper entitled

**H Zheng, MJ Grayling, P Mozgunov, T Jaki, JMS Wason. (2021) Bayesian sample size determination in basket trials borrowing information between subsets. Biostatistics. Epub ahead of print. https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxac033**

Several R packages need to be installed. The user will read such required packages from lines 2 -- 7 of the R script entitled 'subfun_and_simulators.R'.

For any issues or technical questions relating to the implementation, please contact Dr Haiyan Zheng at haiyan.zheng@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk
